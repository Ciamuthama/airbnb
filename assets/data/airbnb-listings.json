My friends also call me \"Gusty\". As a \"citizen of the world\",  I am lucky to have grown and evolved through many cultures. I was born and raised in Yaound\u00e9 in the beautiful country of Cameroon.  At age 20, I moved to Colorado to attend the U.S Air Force Academy where I studied electrical engineering and trained and competed in collegiate boxing. I went on the graduate school and completed a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering with an emphasis in radar and electromagnetic wave propagation. I work as a consultant for fiber distributed antennas systems for better speed and data rates inside high-capacity building for technologies such as 4G LTE and Wi-Fi. I am also working on several other entrepreneurial ventures that I hope will spread all over the world soon. I love to travel for work or pleasure, meet new people, and experience new foods and cultures. I love to train in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and I bring my kimono everywhere I go.  I also love trail running, high altitude hiking, boxing, Thai boxing, wrestling, mma, and yoga. My favorite places to go include San Francisco, Denver, Yaound\u00e9, Nairobi, and Malawi. I would love to visit Brazil to train BJJ and Iceland to hike an active volcano next. I am a huge James Bond fan. My favorites 007 movie are Octopussy and Die Another Day. I like to catch a Jazz or Reggae show when possible.  I love all kinds of food and I will eat anything, especially lots of spices, fish, vegetables and meats. When I travel I love to feel fully immerse into the local culture. That is why I don\u2019t hotels anymore else absolutely necessary. When I host a guest, I treat them like an old friend who visiting from another town. I want to them be as comfortable as possible and fully enjoy their stay. I tell them about places to see and what restaurants to try. I am fluent in English, French and I am learning Portuguese and Spanish.

I really tried to bring the Mid-Century building up to modern standards by simplifying the floor plans, making the bathroom bigger, putting in new double-glazed vinyl windows, insulation in the ceiling, modern kitchen & bathroom, and washer/drying, dishwasher, big fridge, microwave vented to outside, and central air and heat instead of the old space heater. It is now very nice. \r\n\r\nI like design in cars, apartments, graphics, etc. I collect the paintings of Maggie Thomas Topping, and have several on display. She is a wonderful painter. Sometimes I just sit and look at the one in the living room. I hung the one in the bedroom up high, because that replicates the vantage point of the artist when she painted it. There is so much in her work. I get an aesthetic response from it. And, I look for that, that emotional buzz like no other feeling. It taps into our creative side. It is unique. It is like the rush you get when you hear a certain piece of music, or see a sunset, or anything that does it just for you. It can be in cars, architecture, etc. Anything that doesn't give that spark isn't work looking at, or listening to...to me anyway.\r\n\r\nRight now I am in Africa, where we have a second home. So we put our L.A. apartment up for others to use and enjoy. Our able assistant, Colleen, handles it for us, She does a great job. If you take our place you will meet her when she welcomes you.\r\n\r\nI like guests seeing and enjoying our apartment. It is sort of like being an actor and hearing applause, real or imagined. (Helps with the mortgage, too!)\r\n\r\nI especially respond to great design in cars. My fave car was my 1950 Studebaker Starlight Coupe, designed by Raymond Loewy, with the wrap-around rear window, and nose-cone front end. I also had a '55 Studebaker Coupe which was way ahead of its time, by the same designer. And I loved owning until a few years ago: a '93 Cadillac Coupe de Ville, bought used, in charcoal color, the last Coupe de Ville made. \r\n\r\nI go to classic car shows in California, and take lots of pictures. \r\nBiking is more than a hobby. I get into a zone like i did when i experienced the freedome of movement on my bike as a kid, growing up in Long Island. I still get something like a meditative state going on a bike. So, I bike whenever I can. \r\n\r\nOn my way to Nairobi recently, I spent a week in London, where I rented a bike from the Fat Tire Company, near Regents Park, a great place for biking. Fat Tire was started by an American living in Paris, and has a branch in Berlin, where I rented their bike also. I believe they operate in Madrid, and I want to rent there, too. Copenhagen was the best place to get around on a bike because they really have really good bike lanes and roads. A huge amount of the residents bike all the time. It was a lot of fun belonging to that culture temporarily.\r\n\r\nIn Los Angeles and Pasadena, I have been to several Cyclavia events, which are when they close areas of the city to cars. It's just bikes, skates, boards, etc. There is so much enjoyment by so many people, it is really a great day, taking back L.A. from the cars!\r\n\r\nIn Nairobi, I bike in the Karura Forest, about the only place safe enough, and it is really beautiful and peaceful.\r\n\r\nIn Los Angeles, I have a bike at my place you can use - at your own risk of course. (God! Lawyers!)\r\n\r\nOur place is really handy for biking. You can go to the grocery store, restaurants, The Grove mall & cinemas, Starbucks, and several parks. There is a very nice and reasonably priced genuine French restaurant within biking distance on Pico Blvd near us, called Chic. We go there frequently.\r\n\r\nSome days I don't touch the car at all when I am in L.A. Amazing! Imagine that! I hope you will try it if you are into biking. It is such a great way to get exercise, among other things.", "host_response_time": "within a day", "host_response_rate": 100, "host_acceptance_rate": null, "host_thumbnail_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/fdec8880-bdeb-4050-8ef7-7266f10d4c66.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small", "host_picture_url": "https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/fdec8880-bdeb-4050-8ef7-7266f10d4c66.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium", "host_neighbourhood": "Mid-Wilshire", "host_listings_count": 1, "host_total_listings_count": 1, "host_verifications": ["email", "phone", "reviews", "jumio"], "street": "Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles, CA 90019, United States", "neighbourhood": "Mid-Wilshire", "neighbourhood_cleansed": "Mid-Wilshire", "neighbourhood_group_cleansed": null, "city": "Los Angeles", "state": "CA", "zipcode": "90019", "market": "Los Angeles", "smart_location": "Los Angeles, CA", "country_code": "US", "country": "United States", "latitude": "34.05209274792389", "longitude": "-118.35194753222837", "property_type": "Apartment", "room_type": "Entire home/apt", "accommodates": 3, "bathrooms": 1.0, "bedrooms": 2, "beds": 2, "bed_type": "Real Bed", "amenities": ["TV", "Cable TV", "Internet", "Wireless Internet", "Air conditioning", "Kitchen", "Free parking on premises", "Heating", "Family/kid friendly", "Washer", "Dryer", "Smoke detector", "Carbon monoxide detector", "Fire extinguisher", "Essentials", "Shampoo", "24-hour check-in", "Hangers", "Hair dryer", "Iron", "Laptop friendly workspace", "Self Check-In", "Keypad"], "square_feet": null, "price": 109, "weekly_price": null, "monthly_price": null, "security_deposit": 300, "cleaning_fee": 85, "guests_included": 4, "extra_people": 0, "minimum_nights": 3, "maximum_nights": 1125, "calendar_updated": "2 days ago", "has_availability": null, "availability_30": 0, "availability_60": 0, "availability_90": 7, "availability_365": 266, "calendar_last_scraped": "2017-05-03", "number_of_reviews": 28, "first_review": "2016-01-06", "last_review": "2017-04-15", "review_scores_rating": 99, "review_scores_accuracy": 10, "review_scores_cleanliness": 10, "review_scores_checkin": 10, "review_scores_communication": 10, "review_scores_location": 9, "review_scores_value": 10, "license": null, "jurisdiction_names": "City of Los Angeles, CA", "cancellation_policy": "strict", "calculated_host_listings_count": 1, "reviews_per_month": 1.74, "geolocation": {"lon": -118.35194753222837, "lat": 34.05209274792389}, "features": ["Host Is Superhost", "Host Has Profile Pic", "Host Identity Verified", "Is Location Exact", "Instant Bookable"]},{"id": "14820957", "listing_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14820957", "scrape_id": "20170510102046", "last_scraped": "2017-05-10", "name": "Lovely day bed private room", "summary": "I have a 4BR apartment.

We use AirBnB for the Garden Apartment (totally private) and upstairs on the 3rd floor we have up to three bedrooms that's available most days and every other weekend (when my kids are not staying with me). We also have a luxury 1 bedroom flat downtown in River North. Plus hope to be adding another River North location very soon. \r\nI enjoy going on bike rides to the beach with my kids, and my girlfriend and her kids. I love to read and I am a tech geek (obviously, as I work for Apple). I am a coffee OR tea drinker and after drinking both black for almost forty years, I have started using cream in them \u2014 a habit I picked up in Nairobi, Kenya a couple years ago when I was doing some missionary work (plus my girlfriend uses cream and so I have no choice). \r\nIf I had to pick some things I can't live without: my girlfriend (and her boys); my kids; my technology; my morning coffee; my fellowship; and my friends. And I love to watch movies. Old. New. Comedy. Mystery. Action. It doesn't matter. I like them all. \r\nI enjoy working out \u2014 lifting weights and riding a bike, plus I am a life-long swimmer. \r\nI am totally new to AirBnB and I have never been a guest \u2014 but I have friends and family who are guests (and hosts) and I just decided to do this instead of renting out the garden apartment this year. \r\nI am a pretty laid back guy. I like things to be neat and tidy, but it's hard to do without motivation. AirBnB has been the motivation to get our place all tricked out and we are very proud of it.

That's my three youngest kids in the scooter sidecar with me. My oldest is all grown up and just graduated from law school in Texas. \r\nI work for Apple. We own the entire building and I work and live (some of the time) on the third floor with tenants on first and second floors. We use AirBnB for the Garden Apartment (totally private) and upstairs on the 3rd floor we have up to three bedrooms that's available most days and every other weekend (when my kids are not staying with me). We also have a luxury 1 bedroom flat downtown in River North. Plus hope to be adding another River North location very soon. \r\nI enjoy going on bike rides to the beach with my kids, and my girlfriend and her kids. I love to read and I am a tech geek (obviously, as I work for Apple). I am a coffee OR tea drinker and after drinking both black for almost forty years, I have started using cream in them \u2014 a habit I picked up in Nairobi, Kenya a couple years ago when I was doing some missionary work (plus my girlfriend uses cream and so I have no choice). \r\nIf I had to pick some things I can't live without: my girlfriend (and her boys); my kids; my technology; my morning coffee; my fellowship; and my friends. And I love to watch movies. Old. New. Comedy. Mystery. Action. It doesn't matter. I like them all. \r\nI enjoy working out \u2014 lifting weights and riding a bike, plus I am a life-long swimmer. \r\nI am totally new to AirBnB and I have never been a guest \u2014 but I have friends and family who are guests (and hosts) and I just decided to do this instead of renting out the garden apartment this year. \r\nI am a pretty laid back guy.

My friends also call me \"Gusty\". As a \"citizen of the world\",  I am lucky to have grown and evolved through many cultures. I was born and raised in Yaound\u00e9 in the beautiful country of Cameroon.  At age 20, I moved to Colorado to attend the U.S Air Force Academy where I studied electrical engineering and trained and competed in collegiate boxing. I went on the graduate school and completed a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering with an emphasis in radar and electromagnetic wave propagation. I work as a consultant for fiber distributed antennas systems for better speed and data rates inside high-capacity building for technologies such as 4G LTE and Wi-Fi. I am also working on several other entrepreneurial ventures that I hope will spread all over the world soon. I love to travel for work or pleasure, meet new people, and experience new foods and cultures. I love to train in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and I bring my kimono everywhere I go.  I also love trail running, high altitude hiking, boxing, Thai boxing, wrestling, mma, and yoga. My favorite places to go include San Francisco, Denver, Yaound\u00e9, Nairobi, and Malawi. I would love to visit Brazil to train BJJ and Iceland to hike an active volcano next. I am a huge James Bond fan. My favorites 007 movie are Octopussy and Die Another Day. I like to catch a Jazz or Reggae show when possible.  I love all kinds of food and I will eat anything, especially lots of spices, fish, vegetables and meats. When I travel I love to feel fully immerse into the local culture. That is why I don\u2019t hotels anymore else absolutely necessary. When I host a guest, I treat them like an old friend who visiting from another town. I want to them be as comfortable as possible and fully enjoy their stay. I tell them about places to see and what restaurants to try. I am fluent in English, French and I am learning Portuguese and Spanish.

That's my three youngest kids in the scooter sidecar with me. My oldest is all grown up and just graduated from law school in Texas. \r\nI work for Apple. We own the entire building and I work and live (some of the time) on the third floor with tenants on first and second floors. We use AirBnB for the Garden Apartment (totally private) and upstairs on the 3rd floor we have up to three bedrooms that's available most days and every other weekend (when my kids are not staying with me). We also have a luxury 1 bedroom flat downtown in River North. Plus hope to be adding another River North location very soon. \r\nI enjoy going on bike rides to the beach with my kids, and my girlfriend and her kids. I love to read and I am a tech geek (obviously, as I work for Apple). I am a coffee OR tea drinker and after drinking both black for almost forty years, I have started using cream in them \u2014 a habit I picked up in Nairobi, Kenya a couple years ago when I was doing some missionary work (plus my girlfriend uses cream and so I have no choice). \r\nIf I had to pick some things I can't live without: my girlfriend (and her boys); my kids; my technology; my morning coffee; my fellowship; and my friends. And I love to watch movies. Old. New. Comedy. Mystery. Action. It doesn't matter. I like them all. \r\nI enjoy working out \u2014 lifting weights and riding a bike, plus I am a life-long swimmer. \r\nI am totally new to AirBnB and I have never been a guest \u2014 but I have friends and family who are guests (and hosts) and I just decided to do this instead of renting out the garden apartment this year. \r\nI am a pretty laid back guy. I like things to be neat and tidy, but it's hard to do without motivation. AirBnB has been the motivation to get our place all tricked out and we are very proud of it. We hope you will enjoy staying here. All of our units are in a great neighborhood\u2014in a great city.

After East Timor became independent, Lynn went on to work with Amnesty International, and then pursue a PhD in political science with a focus on the Horn of Africa. Lynn spent a year in Nairobi working with the UN on Somalia, and she is now Director of Global Programs at Freedom House (an NGO cofounded by Eleanor Roosevelt). I moved from a singular focus on East Timor to a singular focus on Iraq, founding the Education for Peace in Iraq Center (EPIC) in 1998. EPIC works to promote peace in Iraq through US-based advocacy, research, and field work. A couple years ago, Lynn and I adopted our son, Caleb, from Ethiopia, and he has been a source of joy in our lives ever since. We both love being near the ocean, reading fiction especially mystery novels, good movies, Mad Men, Star Trek, biking, hiking, kayaking, vegetarian cooking, dining out, and travel. More recently, we've rediscovered the joys of sandboxes, trains, blocks, kites, and blowing bubbles.

I've taken mini trips to Israel, Argentina, Belgium, Mexico and Costa Rica so I'd love to chat with you folks about travel experiences. \r\n\r\nI like to dance a lot, spend my time traveling the world, interested in anything to do with the Canadian criminal justice system + its intersections with race, gender and sexuality, speak french and spanish, and when I'm home I spend most of my time watching anime or rollerblading around the city! \r\n\r\nLooking forward to connecting!\r\n\r\n- Kev\r\n________\r\n\r\nHey, my name is Amy!

It now covers about 200 acres (80 ha), the residue of the historic Hounslow Heath that covered over 4,000 acres (1,600 ha). The Heath has major historical importance: routes from London to the west and southwest of Britain used to pass through it. Staines Road, the northern boundary of the present Heath, was the Roman Road, Trinobantes. There are several historic references to Roman camps on or close to the Heath. Continuous recorded history dates back to Norman times. It gave its name to the former hamlet of Heathrow. Hounslow has a very high immigration rate. According to the 2011 Census, more than 50% of Hounslow residents are born outside of the UK.
